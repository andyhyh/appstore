The intention of this package is to show how the libraries in Helm
easily can be used to build a application or plugins that interacts with Tiller.

### Setup
1. Compile Helm from source by following
   [this guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md#from-source-linux-macos).
2. Start Tiller locally, as described
   [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md#running-tiller-locally).
3. Compile and run this package. This will create an instance of MySQL in the current cluster.
